                    <p>The first real portfolio I ever created for myself. I had the good fortune of starting it in the summer before my second year of University then realising that one of my required outputs for that year was, in fact, a portfolio. I still do really like this portfolio, simply because it taught me so much about layout, code and typography. </p>

Unfortunately I can’t do that and thus I had to choose just one area, so I choose web design, <span class="cursive small">With a bit of graphic design and illustration thrown in for good measure..</span></p><br><p> If you’re looking for someone who gets excited about the perfect font pairing and slick micro interactions then I’m who you’re looking for.</p><br><br>
