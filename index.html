                <p>The first real portfolio I ever created for myself. I had the good fortune of starting it in the summer before my second year of University then realising that one of my required outputs for that year was in fact a portfolio. I still do really like this portfolio, simply because it taught me so much about layout and code and typography. </p>

        <p>My mother was an artist.</p><p> My father was a physicist. </p><p>I guess when you put those two thing together you get a web designer.</p><br><p> I have a love for all things design and in a perfect world I would be able to clone myself and send myself off to work in photography, architecture, graphic design and about twenty other fields. Unfortunately I can’t and thus I had to choose just one area, so I choose web design.</p><br><p> If you’re looking for someone who gets excited about the perfect font pairing and slick micro interactions then I’m who you’re looking for.</p>
