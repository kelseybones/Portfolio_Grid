            <h2>About Madlug</h2>
            <p> 
                Madlug is a Community Interest Company (C.I.C) that was founded in 2015 by Dave Linton. A man whose only experience in the luggage industry was bags of enthusiasm. This 40-something Youth Worker was heartbroken to learn that most children in care transport their worldly belongings in a bin bag. In that moment, Dave set out to do something about it. With just £480, he started Madlug and came up with our ‘Buy one Give one’ approach: with every bag you purchase, one will be given to a child in care.

            <p>We carried out a number of research methods on this project, the first being a heuristic review of the site; both desktop and mobile. This allowed us to get a quick overview of areas that could be improved and guided us when creating our hypothesis of where users may be dropping off. </p>

            <p>From this we looked at the analytics which had been implemented, this gave us a better sense of where users were coming from, the devices they were using and where on the site they were dropping off. The results from this supported our initial hypothesis. From theses two activities we were able to write out a series of tasks to be carried out by users in a a number of usability tests.

            <p>While the tests were live we looked at comparators: Toms and State Bags. This helped us understand how these businesses approached the same challenges as Madlug. And also helped us highlight to Madlug the importance of following certain design patterns which users have come to expect. </p>

            <p>Once the usability tests had came back we were able to consolidate all our research into one document which showed the areas to improve, the research findings which backed this up and then the recommendations based on theses findings and the results of the comparator review. From this we were able to create a set of mobile wireframes which helped Madlug clearly go in the right direction when making these improvements to their site.
