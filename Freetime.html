            <p> 
                Freetime is the title of my major project for the final year of my degree in Interaction Design and is currently still ongoing. Freetime is an iOS mobile application that helps people get together with their friends and family more often by linking with their calendars to suggest a date when everyone is free.

            <h2 class="our_work">Discovery Phase</h2>
            <p>At the start of the project I conducted a month long ‘discovery’ phase which allowed me to concentrate on research. During this time I carried out a very large survey which got over 120 responses, this allowed me to create my user personas and helped me generate my initial feature set. I also carried out research on comparators and competitors by doing benchmarking usability tests. This showed me the areas in the market that had gaps and what users thought was missing from existing apps.

        <div class="text">
            <p>From this initial research I was able to start generating content, I created the on boarding journeys for the app, which showed what content was required to answer users questions and help convert them to download. I also created a flow chart of what I thought the initial flow of the app might be, using very low fidelity screens.

            <h2 class="our_work">Design Phase</h2>
            <p>At this point I was able to start generating screes properly, I initially created over 40 wireframes and went on to create over 80 final screens in total. During this time I was also continuing testing, via first click tests, usability tests and a tree sort to check that my navigation matched user expectations for layout. </p>

            <p>I have now moved into the prototyping and devlopment stage of my project. I have been using the new InVision Studio to connect the screens and animate between them. I have also been working on designing and developing a promotional website for the app.
