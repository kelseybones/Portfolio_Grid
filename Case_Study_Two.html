            <p>I was provided with an existing piece of content, which was carefully developed to include a broad range of content types. Without the burden of having to generate content, I was encouraged to develop a single page web site, where the use of narrative and storytelling is brought to the fore. The content is sectioned, with various asides, maps and charts, allowing for considerable creative interpretation. </p>

            <p>The main problem I came up against in this project was how to display so much content in an easy to absorb way. I started by looking at sites such as Wikipedia and the current National Geographic website. <br>These sites display information in a way that makes it easy for the user to navigate to the specific piece of information they want. I realised that having in page navigation was going to be important to this project. </p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>I had to ensure that the content was broken up into clear sections with enough white space to allow the user to have a moment to absorb before being hit with the next piece of information. <br>I wanted the content to speak for itself but I also wanted to add in small delighters throughout to keep the user interacting with the site as they scrolled down the page. </p><br>

            <p>National Geographic has a very strong brand, part of that brand is their beautiful use of imagery to set the scene and portray the mood of the article to their reader. It was important to me to keep this essential part of their brand within my design. So I searched high and low for images that I could use throughout the article. One of my favourite sites Pexels was implemented in this search. <br>Bring all these elements together and you get this; <br>You can also view the site live <a href="http://kelseybones.github.io/Takahe-Website/#">here. </a></p>
